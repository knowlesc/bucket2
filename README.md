# bucket2

To view the app, go to [http://knowlesc.github.io/bucket2](http://knowlesc.github.io/bucket2).

This app was made to help pick random teams when we play EA NHL games. We have been previously drawing names out of a bucket, and it was annoying to keep track of everything. 

There are three different pages:
1. Players: A page to enter the names of who is playing and either manually or randomly assign players to teams.
2. Draft: A page to "draft" NHL teams, for example if you want to randomly choose which NHL team to play as from a pool of random teams (as you might normally do by hitting "random" on the team selection in the game), or if you want to do a fantasy draft and only be able to pick from a certain set of NHL teams. 
3. Sides: A page to draw for which side gets to play as the home team.
